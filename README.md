# Bayesian-Methods

This is my github repository for Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning.

* The course builds upon preexisting understanding of ML methods, and places them in the context of Bayesian statistics.
  * Many key concepts are covered: conjugate priors, latent variable modes, gaussian mixtures, expectation maximisation, variational inference, latent dirichlet allocation, MCMC with Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling, variational autoencoders, and bayesian optimization
  * The final project involved designing an algorithm to help a user generate faces with certain properties from a variational autoencoder: Initially I show the user different faces, then the user is progressively shown faces and asking to rate them. Using these values and GPyOpt, the code adjusts the latent variables of the VAE to approach the face the user wants.
